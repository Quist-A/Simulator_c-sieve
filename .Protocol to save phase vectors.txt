PROTOCOL TO STORE PHASE VECTORS

This is a protocol to export and store phase vectors from the simulator of the c-sieve to import them in the post-processing simulator. 
For an example to save and load: see below.

===========================

LOCATION

Phase vectors are stored in the folder Phasevectors


===========================

COMPRESSION

Phase vectors are compressed as .npz files.


===========================

FORMAT OF STORAGE

Phase vectors are saved in the following format:

data = array([array([multipliers]),L_realized,S,N])


Summarized:

multipliers = data[0]
L = data[1]
S = data[2]
N = data[3]


===========================

EXAMPLE OF STORAGE AND LOAD

outfile = "Phasevectors/My_Saved_Phasevector.npz"
np.savez_compressed(outfile, data=my_phasevector)

infile = "Phasevectors/My_Saved_Phasevector.npz"
data=np.load(infile,allow_pickle=True)['data']
multipliers = data[0]
L = data[1]
S = data[2]
N = data[3]


===========================

FILENAME STANDARD

Files should have the following name:

phasevector_L_S_N_r_n.npz

where L, S, N and r are the decimal representations of the corresponding parameter and n = 0,1,2,... in the index of the run.
