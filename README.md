This repository belongs to the Master Thesis of Arend-Jan Quist (2022).
It consists of simulations on the collimation sieve and post-processing algorithm from Peikert (2020).

# Simulator_c-sieve

Simulator of the collimation sieve as described by Peikert (2020). 
An analysis of the distribution of the multipliers is added to the simulator code. This shows to be binomial distributed.
